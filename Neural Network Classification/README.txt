Neural Network Classification training program

To use this program, make sure that you have a python 3.5 instance in your environment variables as "python", and run the batch file.

Alternatively, open the command line, navigate to this directory and type:
	[path_to_python_3.5] TestClassifier.py

This will generate a folder called 'demoOutput', which will contain the dataset files generated by the training procedure, as well as the completed model with its labels.


In this directory:

///data///
	Contains pre-acquired training and validation images for 12 different classes of foods

///models///
	Contains a pre-trained model with 5 classes, and 12 classes, and their label files

///uglies///
	Contains some common images that are presented when image-net servers do not have the image anymore

///prepare_images.py///
	This is used to gather images from an image-net synset.

///TestClassifier///
	Contains all training functions, as well as the FoodClassifier object that is used in the program.
